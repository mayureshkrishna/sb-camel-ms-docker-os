# Create and Deploy Spring Boot Application on OpenShift using the Docker Image pushed to local OpenShift Registry

**Prerequisites:**

*  You understand containers and played around with Docker
* You have a prior understanding of OpenShift Concepts i.e, pods, services, routes, deployment configuration, imagestream etc.
* `Git` client and `oc` client are installed on your workstation
* OpenShift Local cluster is up and running

### Create the application using the container image and expose the service as a route.

```
$ oc new-app --docker-image="172.30.252.5:5000/myproject/customer-comments:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
--> Found Docker image da18d70 (9 minutes old) from 172.30.252.5:5000 for "172.30.252.5:5000/myproject/customer-comments:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"

    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "customer-comments"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "customer-comments"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "customer-comments"
    * This image declares volumes and will default to use non-persistent, host-local storage.
      You can add persistent volumes later by running 'volume dc/customer-comments --add ...'
    * WARNING: Image "172.30.252.5:5000/myproject/customer-comments:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources ...
    deploymentconfig "customer-comments" created
    service "customer-comments" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.

$ oc expose svc/customer-comments
route "customer-comments" exposed

```
Check the route and test it.

```
$ oc get route
NAME                HOST/PORT                                        PATH      SERVICES            PORT       TERMINATION
customer-comments   customer-comments-myproject.192.168.1.20.xip.io             customer-comments   8080-tcp   

$ curl http://customer-comments-myproject.192.168.1.20.xip.io/customer/account/v1/comments/search
[{"accountNumber":null,"customerName":"John Doe","commentId":"1","entryDate":"1170101","sequenceNumber":"001","commentLineText":"This is a mock test comment","userId":"JDOE"}]
```

Alternatively, you can run the service in your browser at [http://customer-comments-myproject.192.168.1.20.xip.io/customer/account/v1/comments/search](http://customer-comments-myproject.192.168.1.20.xip.io/customer/account/v1/comments/search) and should get same JSON string back.

You have learnt how to build a Container Image and test it locally without pushing into an external registry!!
